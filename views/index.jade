                  p Schnitzer Steel is a global leader in the metals recycling industry that has grown from a single person operation in 1906 to a Fortune 1000 company today.

                  p Schnitzer tapped CSG to architect and develop their four public websites back in 2007. When it came time to freshen up Schnitzer's main website, Schnitzer asked CSG to implement their new designs. CSG took things a step further by using a "responsive design" approach that ensures the site works well on desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones.

                  p With 15 dealerships in four Western states, Kuni Automotive was looking for a cost effective way to keep sales staff, inventory and management all on the same web-accessible platform. Enter CSG Pro and SharePoint.
                  p After weighing the options between creation and deployment of SharePoint 2013 on premise versus online the results were clear. SharePoint Online was clearly more cost-effective. It offered the rapid startup and flexibility Kuni was searching for without having to build any additional infrastructure or support beyond their existing capabilities.
                  p Having pioneered 0365/SharePoint Online engagements, CSG Pro gave them a turnkey and perhaps more important&mdash;hassle-free deployment. Kuni now had a topology to measure its effectiveness and their staff had a central place where they could collaborate online. The result? Sales kept driving forward.

                  p Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative (OBRC) processes virtually 100% of recyclable containers redeemed throughout Oregon. Know Your Nickel, a campaign by OBRC and their branding agency, was created to educate the public on the impact of recycling.
                  p CSG expanded the campaign message through web and mobile by creating a development strategy that included: cloud hosting, mobile design, responsive development, and localization. CSG used HTML5, CSS3 and Windows Azure was selected as the hosting platform.
                  p The flexibility of Azure’s cloud hosting ensured website availability regardless of high usage spikes. Featured on NPR, Oregon Live and billboards across the Portland Metro area, the web campaign launched successfully and continues to deliver this important message.

                  p McMenamins Pubs & Breweries operates a portfolio of more than fifty pubs, hotels, microbreweries, and music venues.
                  p An existing SharePoint 2007 cash deposit solution that populated a SQL Server database with an InfoPath form caused unnecessary complexity and user complaints for McMenamins. A long-term vision that included solutions for Labor Reporting, Food Specials Approvals and Wine Order reporting prompted McMenamins to upgrade to SharePoint 2013 Enterprise.
                  p CSG worked with McMenamins to architect a cash flow deposit solution that used SharePoint 2013’s Business Connectivity Services to connect the cash deposits table in the data warehouse directly to a SharePoint External List. This reduced the complexity and provided McMenamins with a SharePoint 2013 solution that supported their long-term vision.

                  p Oregon International Air Freight (OIA) is a leading third-party logistics provider that offers freight forwarding, warehousing, distribution, customs brokering, global sourcing, and creative packaging solutions.
                  p As a leader in logistics, OIA sought creative ways to efficiently utilize all software and database systems that were helping them lead the industry yet required considerable amounts of manual effort to maintain. CSG tasks included: requirements analysis, backend data modeling, new SharePoint lists, and new ETL processes.
                  p CSG built a highly functional, time-saving, and user-friendly dashboard that leveraged Microsoft SQL Server, Excel, PowerPivot, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and SharePoint. It delivered essential information required for managing the logistics and packaging divisions.

                    p “There’s an app for that”. That simple phrase really encapsulates the dramatic changes in development over the last few years. But what if there’s not an app for that?

                    p Cloud computing is the most disruptive technology to emerge in the information age. It has leveled the playing field of the technological competitive landscape by enabling organizations to create infinitely scalable, fault tolerant, and secure compute environments with little to no capital investment. As a result, a wave of innovation is building that dwarfs all of the major information technology trends of the past. The on-demand availability of cloud services means that competitiveness has a lot less to do with the size of the organization and more to do with the quality and creativity of the solution.
                    p We have leveraged the cloud to build highly functional websites, scalable data-marts for real time analytics, and robust line of business applications. In every case there are specific business requirements, demand for high security, scalability and a need for long-term support. Because the infrastructure already exists, the time to build and launch a production solution is often greatly reduced.
                    p So at CSG, the question we always ask is … why not the cloud? When designing solutions for our clients our approach is certainly holistic; leverage current on-premises investments while giving full consideration for how cloud services can provide optimal benefit. Intelligent architecture and creativity are the key ingredients for a great solution. Whether you are well versed in cloud technologies or unsure of the difference between PaaS and SaaS, we’ll work with you to apply our knowledge and experience to achieve the results you are striving for.

                    p Companies can gain more value from their business data by using it to empower people to make well-informed decisions. Traditionally this has meant a business analyst exposing historical data through spreadsheets and reports. Today, rapidly emerging cloud and mobile technologies are transforming the way information is used.
                    p Researchers, data scientists, and marketers are analyzing very large volumes of unstructured data from previously untapped sources such as e-mails, customer service records, sensor data, and security logs. Now that companies have the ability to deal with so much more data, they are free to incorporate a greater variety of data into the mix. For example, social media, demographics, census, mobile phone, traffic, and weather data can be incorporated with more traditional sources to give context to business intelligence. The goal is to use more data, more elements and better analysis until clear patterns emerge.
                    p As business leaders begin to recognize the potential of big data, they realize that the biggest insights and hidden gems of knowledge are found when big data actually becomes quite small. CSG’s Analytics and BI solutions are designed to deliver data to you in real-time as actionable information, helping you to make those informed business decisions faster. We have expertise in:
